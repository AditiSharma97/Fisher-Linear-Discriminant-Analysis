# Fisher-Linear-Discriminant-Analysise
Implementation of Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis

There are three datasets that can be used. The file name corresponding to the dataset being used must be changed in the code accordingly.
The points are transformed into one dimension. The distributions are visualised and points corresponding to different classes are shown with different colours.
The classification threshold is determined by plotting normal curves for each class and finding the point of intersection.

Python libraries used:
Pandas
